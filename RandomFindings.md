# 🎊 Random Findings on the Internet 🎊
In this document I'm going to compile a list of various helpful or interesting things I found on the internet.

## 🔧 Helpful Stuff
- [**Dot Paper Generator**](http://sethest.dx.am/dot-paper-generator/)  
  Like writing on dot paper but can't seem to find any that suits all your needs?
  Here you go: The _Dot Paper Generator_ does just that - it generates LaTeX source code using the TikZ package.
  (Also see the original [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/500n51/dot_paper_generator/).)
