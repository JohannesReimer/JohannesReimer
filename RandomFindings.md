In this document I'm going to compile a list of various helpful or interesting things I found on the internet.

## ðŸ”§ Helpful Stuff
- [**Dot Paper Generator**](http://sethest.dx.am/dot-paper-generator/)  
  Like writing on dot paper but can't seem to find any that suits all your needs?
  Here you go: The _Dot Paper Generator_ does just that - it generates LaTeX source code using the TikZ package.
  (Also see the original [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/500n51/dot_paper_generator/).)
- **Windows 11 style PDF icon**  
  Using Firefox or Chrome as your default PDF viewer and being annoyed by the default file icon?
  Check out this article on [how to change the standard PDF icon](https://www.winhelponline.com/blog/set-custom-icon-pdf-files-firefox-default-pdf-viewer/).
  Also, you can download my Windows 11 style ICO file [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M0DKC9jzVYE_8uIAW32szgGXI69m_Sqk?usp=sharing).
