## 💻 Technology and Computers
- [**Twitter Advanced Search**](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/rules-and-filtering/search-operators) 🔧  
  When you know you've seen that one post before but you can't find it anymore, use the advanced search that lets you filter hashtags, profiles, locations, dates, links, photos, ... - all combined with logical AND/OR/NOT operators.
- [**The Noun Project**](https://thenounproject.com/) 🔧🌷  
  Ever searched for a pictogram that represents a thing or concept? This is your go-to website for finding those.
  Just enter the word youre searching an icon for and hundreds of icons will appear.
  (Also check out [my own profile](https://thenounproject.com/johannes-foto/)!)
- [**Dot Paper Generator**](http://sethest.dx.am/dot-paper-generator/) 🔧  
  Like writing on dot paper but can't seem to find any that suits all your needs?
  Here you go: The _Dot Paper Generator_ does just that - it generates LaTeX source code using the TikZ package.
  (Also see the original [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/500n51/dot_paper_generator/).)
- **Windows 11 style PDF icon** 🔧🌷  
  Using Firefox or Chrome as your default PDF viewer and being annoyed by the default file icon?
  Check out this article on [how to change the standard PDF icon](https://www.winhelponline.com/blog/set-custom-icon-pdf-files-firefox-default-pdf-viewer/).
  Also, you can download my Windows 11 style ICO file [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M0DKC9jzVYE_8uIAW32szgGXI69m_Sqk?usp=sharing).

- [**Emojipedia**](https://emojipedia.org/) ❓  
  Its a wikipedia for emojis - that's all. You can view a [random emoji](https://emojipedia.org/random/) or catch up with the [newest emojis](https://emojipedia.org/new/). Also, if you're rally into emojis, check out Tom Scott's [Emojli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIFE7h3m40U) project.

## 👩‍🎓 Science and Education
- [**Sci-Hub**](https://www.sci-hub.se/) 🔧🗳  
  We all know the big for-profit publishing companies that [account for 50 % of all published articles](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4465327/): Elsevier, Springer, Wiley, Taylor & Francis, and Sage.
  We also know how expensive the access to research articles can get and thus, can massively restrict the academic workflow.
  The solution to this problem is called Sci-Hub which unlocks almost every research article or book of every major publishing company just by typing in the URL, DOI or ISBN.
- [**Sci-Hub X Now!**](https://github.com/alphawent/sci-hub-now) 🔧🗳  
  This is a [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/sci-hub-x-now/)/[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sci-hub-x-now/gmmnidkpkgiohfdoenhpghbilmeeagjj)/[Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/scihub-x-now/pgpggidmgechbjbefcnmodgkldndojca?hl=de) extension to instantly get access to papers and books that are availible on [Sci-Hub](https://www.sci-hub.se/) - with a single klick!.
- [**Predatory Journals: Beall's List**](https://beallslist.net/) 🔧🤓  
  You wouldn't believe how many fraudulent and unscientific journals and publishers are out there, trying to get a piece from the cake of scientific publishing.
  Those so called predatory journals and publishers as well as not-peer-reviewed vanity press outlets and more are compiled and updated regularily in "Bealls's List" by American librarian Jeffrey Beall. The websites [Think. Check. Submit.](https://thinkchecksubmit.org/) (journals) and [Think. Check. Attend.](https://thinkcheckattend.org/) (conferences) are helpful, too, following the sequence of 1) whitelist 2) blacklist 3) checklist.
  Here are also an interesting [video](https://www1.wdr.de/mediathek/video/sendungen/quarks-und-co/video-betrug-statt-spitzenforschung---wenn-wissenschaftler-schummeln-100.html) by German public broadcaster WDR as well as an [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03759-y) in Nature and a series of [articles](https://scilogs.spektrum.de/relativ-einfach/abzock-fachzeitschriften-wie-gross-ist-das-problem/) in the German popular science newspaper Spektrum.
- [**#IchBinHanna**](https://ichbinhanna.wordpress.com/) 🗳🤓🇩🇪  
  German research fellows were outraged when the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) released a [video](https://web.archive.org/web/20210611145015/https://www.bmbf.de/de/media-video-16944.html) "explaining" an old law limiting the time one can be employed at German Universities (Wissenschaftszeitvertragsgesetz, WissZeitVG).
  In it, a cartoon character named Hanna seems to be very happy about the law, which isn't at all true for most researchers in Germany.
  Hence, some researchers started to publicly expose their poor working conditions on Twitter and the hashtag [#IchBinHanna](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IchBinHanna) (I am Hanna) went viral.
- [**TVStud**](https://tvstud.de/) 🗳🤓🇩🇪  
  Similarly to the [#IchBinHanna](https://ichbinhanna.wordpress.com/) movement, students who work at universities in Germany are rising up and demand better working conditions as well as collective labour agreements.
  Despite many students working overtime and not getting sick pay and paid leave, they're only earning ever so slightly more than minimum wage.  
  Many believe (me included) that this doesn't do justice to the important work of student assistants in research and teaching.

## 🚂 Travelling with Deutsche Bahn
- [**BahnMining**](https://www.dkriesel.com/blog/2019/1229_video_und_folien_meines_36c3-vortrags_bahnmining) 🤓🤣🔧🇩🇪  
  Did you ever have to change the train at Mannheim central station and didn't catch your connecting train? Wonder why?
  David Kriesel has the answer: Its statistics, and big data.
  In his talk, he takes you on a journey deep down the rabbit hole of travelling by train in Germany - from a data specialist's perspective - and provides some useful tips on how to travel more stress free. 
- [**Der Lokvogel**](https://sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de/tag/der-lokvogel-bahnfahrerkolumne) 🤓🤣🔧🇩🇪  
  Frederik Jötten frequently writes about travelling by train (particularily in Germany) and the problems that arise trying to simply get from A to B.
  He geniously converts his anger and frustration into, in my opinion, very well written, easy to read and extremely funny articles.
  While giving the readers the feeling of being fellow sufferers, he also manages to sprinkle in a lot of useful knowledge for mastering the art of travelling by train in Germany.
- [**Marudor**](https://marudor.de/) 🔧🇩🇪  
  Your train is late but the information on the platform display or in the DB app aren't helpful?
  On Marudor.de you will get more insights on why the train is stuck. ([View project on GitHub](https://github.com/marudor/BahnhofsAbfahrten).)

## 💬 Cartoons
- [**PHD Comics**](https://phdcomics.com/) 🤣  
  One of my favourite comics about - you guessed it - working in research.
  Hint: The Website also offers a _stealth mode_ that quickly turns the comic into a "[research paper](https://phdcomics.com/archive_journal.php?n=2048)" (Just click the _Emergency Button_ below the picture).
- [**Dilbert**](https://dilbert.com/) 🤣  
  In this daily comic series, our protagonist Dilbert works for a big corporation.
  And thus, we encounter the all too familiar situations that arise when the manager of the manager of the manager simply has no idea of what matters to an engineer.
- [**The New Yorker Cartoons**](https://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/issue-cartoons) 🤣🗳  
  I mean, the New Yorker cartoons are just classic. In their archive you'll find all the cartoons from as far back as July 28, 2014.
