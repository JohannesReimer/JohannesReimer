- 👋 Hi, I’m @JohannesReimer from Dresden, Germany.
- 🧑‍🎓 I'm a civil engineering student, tutor and assistant at TU Dresden [Institute of Mechanics and Shell Structures](https://tu-dresden.de/bu/bauingenieurwesen/imf).
- 🌱 Currently, I’m studying computational mechanics, focussing on dynamics and thus, I'm gaining experience with Linux, [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)/[Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) and [Fortran](https://fortran-lang.org/). As usual when studying an engineering/math-related subject, I also frequently use [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), both online on [Overleaf](https://de.overleaf.com/) and offline, using [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) with [Atom](https://atom.io/).
- 👀 I’m still new to Github, so I'm just exploring all the fancy repositories and getting excited! Check out my [random findings](https://github.com/JohannesReimer/JohannesReimer/blob/main/RandomFindings.md) on the internet!
- 📷 Also, I'm a passionate hobby photographer (I mostly shoot on film) as well as a tech & design nerd. Head over to my (admittedly quite unmaintained) [website](https://johannes-foto.de/) if you're curious.
