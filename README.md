- 👋 Hi, I’m @JohannesReimer from Dresden, Germany.
- 🧑‍🎓 I'm a civil engineering student, tutor and assistant at TU Dresden [Institute of Mechanics and Shell Structures](https://tu-dresden.de/bu/bauingenieurwesen/imf).
- 🌱 Currently, I’m studying computational mechanics, focussing on dynamics and thus, I'm gaining experience with Linux, [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)/[Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) and [Fortran](https://fortran-lang.org/).
- 👀 I’m still new to Github, so I'm just exploring all the fancy repositories and getting excited! 
- 📷 Also, I'm a passionate hobby photographer (I mostly shoot on film) as well as a tech & design nerd. Head over to my (admittedly quite unmaintained) [website](https://johannes-foto.de/) if you're curious.
- 📧 You can reach me via [email](mailto:jreimer.mail@gmail.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johannes_foto).
