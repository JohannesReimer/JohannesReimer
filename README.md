# Hi, I’m Johannes. 👋
- 🧑‍🎓 I'm a civil engineer (Dipl.-Ing.) and researcher at TU Dresden [Institute of Concrete Structures](https://tu-dresden.de/bu/bauingenieurwesen/imb).
- 🌉 Currently, I’m researching historical prestressed concrete bridges and how to preserve our aging infrastructure.
- As part of my work, I use [Python](https://www.python.org/) quite often, but also gained some experience with Linux, [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)/[Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) and [Fortran](https://fortran-lang.org/) during my studies.
- 📄 As is usual inside research, I also frequently use [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), both online on [Overleaf](https://de.overleaf.com/) and offline, using [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) with [Atom](https://atom.io/).
- 👀 I’m still new to Github, so I'm just exploring all the fancy repositories and getting excited! Check out my [random stuff page](https://github.com/JohannesReimer/ JohannesReimer/blob/main/RandomFindings.md) where I (quite infrequently) add stuff I found on the internet!
- 📷 Also, I'm a passionate hobby photographer (I mostly shoot film and digital) as well as a tech & design nerd. Head over to my (admittedly quite unmaintained) [website](https://johannes-foto.de/) if you're curious.
